# missing_marks_prediction_analysis

## Missing marks and Data loss is a common & chronic problem in most institutions in Kenya.

Its effects came to be largely felt when most institutions; government, non-governmental and private, in the wake of the new millennia, chose to migrate from manual file systems to digital systems.
An analysis of these institutions tries to determine the main causes of data loss and missing marks and circumstances under which data is likely to be lost in these institutions.
While focusing on Kenyan Institutions of higher learning, the project is built on two major pillars; human cause of data loss and machine causes of data loss.
